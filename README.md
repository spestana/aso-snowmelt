### The Problem:
#### Broader Impacts: 
* Tuolumne River Basin is Cali water supply 
* Expecting this climate change “2015 year” temperatures to continue 
* Impacts of climate change on this water supply for future years
* Snow at elevation = water storage 
* Previous work says that snowmelt will be slower in warmer temperatures- hypothesis? 

---

### Application Example:
* Incorporating streamflow, for modeling and water resources prediction
* Used for Model Evaluation 
* Snow accumulation/snow change in depressions, where the model doesn’t capture this

### Data:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uhxMHkf9YgU2qVDntqTGSbzZlJY0v94X
* Snow depth (30m, ASO lidar-derived) 2014 - 2016
* DEM (30m, ASO lidar-derived)

---

### Specific Questions:
* How does the change in snow depth (melt and accumulation) behave as a function of topography (slope, aspect, elevation) in the Tuolumne River watershed?
* How does the change in snow depth (melt and accumulation) behave as a function of forest cover (forested versus not forested) in the Tuolumne River watershed?
* How do these behaviors compare between relatively “normal” snowpack years (2014, 2016) and a year with much lower snowpack (2015 - representative of future conditions due to climate change)? 
* Can we conclude that there is “slower snowmelt in a warmer world” (Musselman et al. 2017)?
